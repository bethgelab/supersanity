# Solving Spatial Supersensing Without Spatial Supersensing

## NoSense
For all experiments involving the NoSense method on the VSR benchmark, please refer to the [NoSense](https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity/tree/main/nosense) folder.

## VSC-Repeat
For all experiments involving the VSC-repeat sanity test on the VSC benchmark, please refer to the [VSC_Repeat](https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity/tree/main/vsc_repeat) folder.

## Plots
You can find and reproduce all our plots in the report with the scripts available in the [plots](https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity/tree/main/plots) folder.

## Results
We saved all our experimental log-files and release them for reproducibility. For NoSense on VSR, the logs are [here](https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity/tree/main/results/vsr_exps) and for VSC-Repeat, the logs are [here](https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity/tree/main/results/vsc_repeat_exps).
